Rules
--------

You may use online libraries, resources, and tools to help you with your assignment. You may make use of any 3rd or 1st party libraries you wish. The only thing you may not do is copy code wholesale from the internet. I understand that an amount of code may be similar to resources you consulted online, and this is no problem, but large scale plagiarism will be dealt with drastically and may result in a mark of 0, or worse, disciplinary action from the exam board.
