The ï£¿ documentation on Core Data is more than good enough for our needs and covers every aspect you could want. In this class we reviewed the following parts:

- [Introduction To Core Data](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CoreData/Articles/cdTechnologyOverview.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009296-SW1)
- [Core Data Basics](https://www.google.ie/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&es_th=1&ie=UTF-8#q=core%20data%20basics&es_th=1)
