OOP2 Lab Test
=====================

The goal of this lab test is to model a system that you can then enter data into, persist it using Core Data, and display it on subsequent launches of the app.

You need to model a system to input college Courses. 
Courses have Students, a Lecturer, and a Room.
Students have names and Grades.
Lecturers have names.
Rooms have numbers.

Model these concepts in Core Data, then provide the following:

- A screen where you can view the courses.
- Upon tapping a course, you should be taken to another screen that shows the lecturer, room and list of students and grades.
- You should be able to enter data into the app somehow. A suggestion would be to use a '+' button to add a course or student. You must be able to add both Courses and Students.
- Courses, Students, etc, should all be persisted in Core Data.

Grading
===================

- 10% for the list of courses.
- 20% for the screen that shows the lecturer, room, and list of students/grades
- 10% for the ability to add students
- 10% for the ability to add courses
- 50% for persisting data in core data / implementing core data

You need to model a system to input college Courses.
Courses have Students, a Lecturer, and a Room.
Students have names and grades.

Model this object graph in Core Data, then provide the following:

- A screen where you can view the courses.
- Upon tapping a course, you should be taken to another screen that shows the lecturer, room and list of students and grades.
- You should then be able to enter data into the app somehow. A suggestion would be to use a '+' button to add a course or student. You must be able to add both Courses and Students.
- Courses, Students, etc, should be persisted in Core Data, between app launches.

Grading
================

- 10% for the list of courses
- 20% for the screen that shows the lecturer, room, and list of students/grades.
- 10% for the ability to add students.
- 10% for the ability to add courses.
- 50% for persisting data in Core Data.

Attempt marks will be given. This test is worth 40% of your final grade.

Plagiarism
===================

There are many instances of a core data 'stack' on the web. These are fine to use if you truly wish (since this is boilerplate code), but I will ask you how it works / is set up if I don't think you understand it.

You are free to use online resources during this test, do not copy code wholesale or from other students, however. This may result in a grading penalty or involving the exam board.

You are free to use online resources for this test to guide you, since Core Data has a lot of boilerplate code, however, if I think you don't understand the concepts themselves (eg: you blindly copypasted it), be prepared to answer some questions :)

Do not blindly copy code from the web or other students. This may result in a grading penalty or involving the exam board.

Tuesday Students
=============

In the interest of fairness, please complete the above test, but add a search field to be able to search the courses. Your search field should perform its query in Core Data, not locally in the table!

Adjustment to grading:
- 10% for this search.
- 40% for persisting data in Core Data. (previously 50%)
